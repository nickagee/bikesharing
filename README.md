# Bikesharing Prediction Project

This is a simple NN approach to predict daily bike rental ridership.

## Data

This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the `cnt` column. You can see the first few rows of the data above.
